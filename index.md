![Lansing Area R Users Group Logo]()The Lansing Area R Users Group (LaRUG) brings together R users in the Lansing area for discussions on data science (analysis and predictive modeling), big data, and all things R. This group provides a relaxed environment to exchange ideas and discuss R. Whether you are new to R (and programming), a statistian, or an advanced user, we are the group for you.

## Monthly Meetings

We hold monthly meetings on the second Monday of the month from 7-9pm at the [Grand Traverse Pie Company](http://gtpie.com) (in the Orchard Room) at the corner of East Grand River Avenue and Haggadorn Road in East Lansing, Michigan [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Traverse+Pie+Company/@42.7302255,-84.4648517,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x8822c29e2298637f:0x65a99056073bd352!2sGrand+Traverse+Pie+Company!8m2!3d42.7302255!4d-84.4626577!3m4!1s0x8822c29e2298637f:0x65a99056073bd352!8m2!3d42.7302255!4d-84.4626577).

The first hour of the meetup is devoted to a specific topic while the second hour is more of an open question and answer session -- or it might be a continuation of the first hour.
