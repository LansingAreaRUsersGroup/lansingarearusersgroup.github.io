<a href="url"><img src="https://lansingarearusersgroup.github.io/images/LansingAreaRUserGroup_CIRCLE-w-Michigan-logo_300dpi.png" align="left" height="200"></a>The May 2017 meetup focused on R packages for text mining and the types of analysis possible.

## R Packages
The `tm` and `tidytext` packages were discussed. Throughout the discussion, `tidytext` was seen as the cleanest way to work with `data.frames`. The `RTextTools` package is another package to perform text mining and sentiment analysis.
- `RTextTools: Automatic Text Classification via Supervised Learning` [CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RTextTools)
- `tidytext: Text Mining using 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and Other Tidy Tools` [CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidytext)
- `tm: Text Mining Package` [CRAN link](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tm)

## `tidytext` Tutorials
The following `tidytext` tutorials are an excellent resource for learning the procedure and protocol for cleaning and analyzing text. The following vignettes and tutorials were the basis for our discussion.
- **`tidytext` vignettes**
  + Introduction to `tidytext` [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html)
  + Tidy Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf) [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tf_idf.html)
  + Converting to and from Document-Term Matrices and Corpus objects [link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidying_casting.html)
