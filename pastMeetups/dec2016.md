**Tableplots** from the [tabplot R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tabplot/) "is a powerful visualization method to explore and analyze large multivariate datasets." The package authors demonstrate the importance of exploring large datasets using tableplots in their June 2015 Significance article [link to freely accessible article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2015.00826.x/full). Tabplot uses ggplot2 to construct the plots and there is an informative vignette [vignette link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tabplot/vignettes/tabplot-vignette.html) demonstrating the use of tabplots via the diamonds dataset.

**Notebooks with R Markdown** are an excellent way to share the results of an analysis along with the workflow and associated R code. RStudio had a webinar [webinar link](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-notebooks-with-r-markdown/) during the summer of 2016 to showcase the features and benefits of using a Notebook compared to the standard [R](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) Markdown document ("HTML, PDF, MS Word, Beamer, HTML5 slides, Tufte-style handouts, books, dashboards, shiny applications, scientific articles, and websites to name a few") constructed with knitr. When creating an analysis document for general audiences and/or R-users, Notebooks provide flexibility and reproducible workflows.

[**dygraphs**](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/index.htmlÂ­) is a new R package for constructing interactive plots within R Markdown documents. These plots focus on the ability for a user to interact with time series data.

**Access to large datasets** is becoming commonplace and the [US Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) along with [Crash Stats](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/#/) of the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](http://www.nhtsa.gov/) provides a large amount of traffic accident related data.
