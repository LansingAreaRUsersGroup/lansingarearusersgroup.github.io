<a href="url"><img src="https://lansingarearusersgroup.github.io/images/LansingAreaRUserGroup_CIRCLE-w-Michigan-logo_300dpi.png" align="left" height="200"></a>The June 2017 meetup was a chance for members to group watch [Data Science 2017: Salaries, Demographics, & Hiring Trends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVDpr5pGOxw) by [Burtch Works](http://www.burtchworks.com). Following the video we had a discussion with Naomi Keller ([please connect with Naomi on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomikeller/)) of Burtch Works about what employers are looking for in a data scientist. 

If you missed the meetup (or want to watch the video again) the video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVDpr5pGOxw) on YouTube. Related videos are available on [Burch Works' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCejelOS3lhDyxTlq_ObSxEw).

The Q&A session with Naomie Keller was very informative and included:

- _**How does one convert a CV to a resume?**_ Your resume should be no more than two pages and include specifics about past and current research projects written for the non-expert while including data science buzzwords.
- _**How hard is it to get your first data scientist job and differentiate oneself from others looking for their first job?**_ There is no universally accepted definition for what a data scientist is or does. Some employers are specifically looking for candidates with PhDs but most want at least a MS or PhD. If you know someone at a company you want to work at ask them for an introduction to the hiring manager.
- _**It seems every job title has "data scientist" in the title. Why?**_ This is due companies trying to get their advertisement for their position in front of as many potential candidates as possible. Carefully read the job posting paying specific attention to the description and types of questions the company is trying to answer along with the desired skills. The combination of desired skills and job functions will tell you a lot about the position.
- _**How big are data science groups?**_ The size of data science groups depends on the organization and the industry.
- _**What are the new hot areas?**_ The internet of things (IoT) is a large and exciting area being developed by companies with internet connected devices. These companies will need data scientists to analyze the data from their products and help answer questions about the customers and their needs.
